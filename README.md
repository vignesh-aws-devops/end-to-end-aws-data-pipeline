ðŸš€ Building a Robust End-to-End Data Pipeline with AWS Glue and Lambda       
   
I am excited to share that Iâ€™ve built an end-to-end, automated ETL pipeline that efficiently transforms raw data into structured, curated datasets. This loosely coupled solution leverages AWS Glue and Lambda to handle data ingestion, transformation, and storage in Amazon RDS, ensuring seamless, scalable, and fault-tolerant analytics and reporting.    

## Key AWS Services   
âœ… Amazon S3: Acts as the ingestion layer triggering the pipeline.   
âœ… AWS Lambda: Validates files, triggers workflows, analyzes data, creates RDS tables dynamically, and ensures data integrity.   
âœ… AWS Glue: Transforms raw data, validates schemas, and loads curated datasets into RDS while updating logs in DynamoDB.   
âœ… Amazon DynamoDB: Tracks timestamps for incremental loads and prevents reprocessing.   
âœ… Amazon SNS: Sends real-time notifications for errors and successful executions.
